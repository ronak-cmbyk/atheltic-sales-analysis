# Athletic Sales Analysis

- This program analyzes two large data sets in the athletic_sales.csv files with the same information from two consecutive years (2020, 2021), respectively.
- The data sets were merged into a common set and grouped by various categorizations to determine the most profitable and highest-selling regions and retailers.
- These sets were made using two methodologies: using the groupby() function and the Panda's Pivot Table function. Both functions arrive with the same output.
- Finally, sales data for the highest-selling individual weeks and days was determined using pivot tables.
